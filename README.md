# Credit-Score-Classification-with-Machine-Learning

  Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness. Today banks and credit card companies use Machine Learning algorithms to classify all the customers in their database based on their credit history.
  
  
# Credit Score Classification

There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

1. Good
2. Standard
3. Poor

A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. For the task of Credit Score Classification, we need a labelled dataset with credit scores.

I found an ideal dataset for this task labelled according to the credit history of credit card customers.You can download the dataset here.https://statso.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Credit-Score-Data.zip

# Credit Score Classification: Case Study

The credit score of a person determines the creditworthiness of the person. It helps financial companies determine if you can repay the loan or credit you are applying for.

Here is a dataset based on the credit score classification submitted by Rohan Paris on Kaggle. Below are all the features in the dataset:

1. ID: Unique ID of the record
2. Customer_ID: Unique ID of the customer
3. Month: Month of the year
4. Name: The name of the person
5. Age: The age of the person
6. SSN: Social Security Number of the person
7. Occupation: The occupation of the person
8. Annual_Income: The Annual Income of the person
9. Monthly_Inhand_Salary: Monthly in-hand salary of the person
10. Num_Bank_Accounts: The number of bank accounts of the person
11. Num_Credit_Card: Number of credit cards the person is having
12. Interest_Rate: The interest rate on the credit card of the person
13. Num_of_Loan: The number of loans taken by the person from the bank
14. Type_of_Loan: The types of loans taken by the person from the bank
15. Delay_from_due_date: The average number of days delayed by the person from the date of payment
16. Num_of_Delayed_Payment: Number of payments delayed by the person
17. Changed_Credit_Card: The percentage change in the credit card limit of the person
18. Num_Credit_Inquiries: The number of credit card inquiries by the person
19. Credit_Mix: Classification of Credit Mix of the customer
20. Outstanding_Debt: The outstanding balance of the person
21. Credit_Utilization_Ratio: The credit utilization ratio of the credit card of the customer
22. Credit_History_Age: The age of the credit history of the person
23. Payment_of_Min_Amount: Yes if the person paid the minimum amount to be paid only, otherwise no.
24. Total_EMI_per_month: The total EMI per month of the person
25. Amount_invested_monthly: The monthly amount invested by the person
26. Payment_Behaviour: The payment behaviour of the person
27. Monthly_Balance: The monthly balance left in the account of the person
28. Credit_Score: The credit score of the person

 The Credit_Score column is the target variable in this problem. You are required to find relationships based on how banks classify credit scores and train a model to classify the credit score of a person.
